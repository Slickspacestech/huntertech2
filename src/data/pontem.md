Case Study: How Huntertech Transformed Pontem Groupâ€™s IT Operations and Cut Costs

Client: Pontem Group
Industry: Fire Suppression and CP Code Consulting
Location: Vancouver
Employees: 20

Overview
Pontem Group, a leading fire suppression and code consulting firm in Vancouver, was grappling with growing IT challenges. With four principals sharing IT responsibilities across a 20-person team, technology was becoming a liability rather than a competitive advantage.

That changed when they partnered with Huntertech.

The Challenge
Before engaging with Huntertech, Pontem Group faced serious IT pain points:

Decentralized IT Management: Four principals juggled IT duties, leading to inconsistent systems and oversight.

Licensing Issues: Software was either over-licensed or under-licensed due to lack of centralized tracking.

Security Risks: Work computers had non-business apps, games, and missing security updates.

Password Mismanagement: Shared credentials, unsecured text files, and no single sign-on system.

Hardware Inefficiencies: Staff used high-powered gaming laptops that were too heavy to travel with, overheated easily, and lacked sufficient memory.

Inadequate Docking Stations: Consumer-grade hardware used displaylink-based docks that caused performance issues.

Data Protection Gaps: Devices were unencrypted, and there was no centralized data security.

Inconsistent User Experience: Different Windows versions, configurations, and app versions across staff devices.

Unmanaged Admin Access: Users were local admins and expected to handle their own software installations and updates.

Network Access Issues: Critical network equipment was installed by a third party, and no internal staff had administrative access.

The Solution
Huntertech implemented a complete IT transformation plan, tailored to Pontem Groupâ€™s needs:

Centralized IT Management
