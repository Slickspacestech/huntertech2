    If you've recently purchased a multi-function printer, or perhaps you want to finally set up scan to email on a soccer free Saturday, then this is the guide to help you do it in 5 minutes and stop pulling your hair out.

    Forget Trying to Read Through Super Technical Instructions
    Microsoft announced they are retiring the old school methods of app passwords and basic auth and all those things that hackers used to exploit their customers so they could scan to email. It was a bad idea anyway, so I applaud them for making it right. So what to do about all those annoying devices, software that wants to send alerts etc?

    Introducing SMTP2GO
    This wonderful service deserves your money even if you would never have a chance of exceeding their free email delivery tier. What you'll need to get started:
    - Your login for your domain registrar/DNS provider
    - A SMTP2GO account

    Setup Your Domain as a Verified Sender
    Sign into your new SMTP2GO account and on the left menu, expand Sending, and click Verified Senders. On the right side of the page, click Add Sender Domain. Type in your domain name (example.com for example).

    Take note of the next screen! These DNS records need to be entered into your DNS settings wherever your DNS records are located. Key information is the _type_ which are CNAME records, Hostname, and Value.

    Add in all 3 records. Click Verify on the SMTP2GO DNS screen. If it doesn't verify then you may have to wait up to 48hrs depending on your DNS provider. Good ones take a couple minutes.

    Create the SMTP User
    After you've been verified, hop on over to SMTP users on the left menu. Click Add SMTP User on the right side. Create the username and password (pick a strong one, or use their auto generated one). These will later be entered into your printer to setup SMTP.

    Configure Your Printer
    Every printer is a bit different here. In your email settings you'll likely have Authentication Method. This is going to be SMTP Auth.

    Username is going to match the username you created in the Add SMTP User step above (printer@yourdomain.com). The password will be the password from the above step.

    The right side of the SMTP2GO gives you the rest of the important details:
    - SMTP Server: mail.smtp2go.com
    - SMTP Port: 2525
    - Alternative/TLS Ports: 8025, 587, 80 or 25. TLS is available on the same ports.
    - SSL is available on ports: 465, 8465 and 443.

    Once you've entered those in you should be able to test the connection with your printer!

    <p class="lead">Learn how to set up scan-to-email functionality on your office printer using Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. This simple 5-minute guide will help you configure your printer for secure email scanning.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace account</li>
        <li>Network-connected printer with scan-to-email capability</li>
        <li>Printer's web interface access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 1: Configure SMTP Settings</h2>
    <p>First, you'll need to set up the SMTP settings on your printer. Here are the common settings for both Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace:</p>

    <h3>Microsoft 365 Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SMTP Server: smtp.office365.com</li>
        <li>Port: 587</li>
        <li>Security: STARTTLS</li>
        <li>Authentication: Required</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Google Workspace Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com</li>
        <li>Port: 587</li>
        <li>Security: STARTTLS</li>
        <li>Authentication: Required</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Create App Password</h2>
    <p>For security reasons, you'll need to create an app password for your printer. This is different from your regular account password.</p>

    <h3>Microsoft 365</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to account.microsoft.com/security</li>
        <li>Select "Security info"</li>
        <li>Add a new app password</li>
        <li>Use this password in your printer settings</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Google Workspace</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to your Google Account settings</li>
        <li>Select "Security"</li>
        <li>Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled</li>
        <li>Create an app password for your printer</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Step 3: Configure Printer</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Access your printer's web interface</li>
        <li>Navigate to the email settings</li>
        <li>Enter the SMTP settings from Step 1</li>
        <li>Use the app password from Step 2</li>
        <li>Test the configuration</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Verify network connectivity</li>
        <li>Check SMTP settings</li>
        <li>Confirm app password is correct</li>
        <li>Ensure firewall isn't blocking port 587</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use app passwords instead of regular passwords</li>
        <li>Enable encryption (STARTTLS)</li>
        <li>Regularly update printer firmware</li>
        <li>Monitor scan logs for unusual activity</li>
    </ul>
