    Why Small Businesses Need Cybersecurity
    Small businesses in Calgary and Vancouver are increasingly becoming targets for cyber attacks. In fact, 43% of all cyber attacks target small businesses. This article will help you understand the essential cybersecurity measures your business needs to implement.

    Essential Cybersecurity Measures
    Regular Software Updates
    Keep all your software, including operating systems and applications, up to date. Regular updates patch security vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.

    Strong Password Policies
    Implement and enforce strong password policies:
    Require passwords to be at least 12 characters long
    Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
    Never reuse passwords across different accounts or services
    Use a password manager to securely store and generate unique passwords
    Never share passwords or write them down, especially in unencrypted files on your computer

    Employee Training
    Your employees are your first line of defense. Regular training on:
    Identifying phishing emails
    Safe browsing practices
    Data handling procedures
    Reporting suspicious activities

    Data Backup Solutions
    Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule:
    3 copies of your data
    2 different storage types
    1 off-site backup

    Advanced Threat Protection
    Modern businesses need more than just antivirus software. Implement these advanced security solutions:
    Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
    Huntress EDR provides advanced threat detection and response capabilities:
    24/7 managed detection and response by security experts
    Automated threat hunting and investigation
    Ransomware and malware detection with instant alerts
    Persistent foothold detection to identify compromised systems
    Automated remediation of detected threats
    Detailed security reports and visibility into your environment
    Integration with Microsoft Defender and other security tools

    Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR)
    Huntress ITDR provides comprehensive identity protection and monitoring:
    24/7 monitoring of Microsoft 365 and Entra ID (Azure AD) environments
    Detection of compromised accounts and suspicious sign-in activities
    Automated investigation of identity-based threats
    Alerting on unauthorized access attempts and privilege escalation
    Monitoring of admin account activities and changes
    Integration with existing security tools and workflows
    Detailed reporting on identity-related security events

    DNS Web Filtering
    DNS web filtering provides an additional layer of security by blocking access to malicious websites and controlling web usage:
    Block access to known malicious websites and phishing domains
    Prevent employees from visiting inappropriate or non-work-related sites
    Protect against malware and ransomware by blocking malicious downloads
    Filter content based on categories
    Enforce safe search settings across all devices
    Detailed reporting on web usage and blocked attempts
    Works across all devices and locations, including remote workers

                    <p>For more detailed information about password security, check out our article on <a href="/blog/password-manager">Why You Should Use a Password Manager</a>.</p>

                    <h3>3. Employee Training</h3>
                    <p>Your employees are your first line of defense. Regular training on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifying phishing emails</li>
                        <li>Safe browsing practices</li>
                        <li>Data handling procedures</li>
                        <li>Reporting suspicious activities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. Data Backup Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 copies of your data</li>
                        <li>2 different storage types</li>
                        <li>1 off-site backup</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Don't forget to backup your cloud services as well:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Microsoft 365 (Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams)</li>
                        <li>Google Workspace data</li>
                        <li>Cloud-based applications and their data</li>
                        <li>Cloud storage services</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remember: Cloud services are not automatically backed up. While they provide redundancy, they don't protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, or malicious actions. A proper backup strategy should include both on-premises and cloud data.</p>
