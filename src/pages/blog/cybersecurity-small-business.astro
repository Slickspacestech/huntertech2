                    <h2>Why Small Businesses Need Cybersecurity</h2>
                    <p>Small businesses in Calgary and Vancouver are increasingly becoming targets for cyber attacks. In fact, 43% of all cyber attacks target small businesses. This article will help you understand the essential cybersecurity measures your business needs to implement.</p>

                    <h2>Essential Cybersecurity Measures</h2>
                    <h3>1. Regular Software Updates</h3>
                    <p>Keep all your software, including operating systems and applications, up to date. Regular updates patch security vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.</p>

                    <h3>2. Strong Password Policies</h3>
                    <p>Implement and enforce strong password policies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Require passwords to be at least 12 characters long</li>
                        <li>Include a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters</li>
                        <li>Never reuse passwords across different accounts or services</li>
                        <li>Use a password manager to securely store and generate unique passwords</li>
                        <li>Never share passwords or write them down, especially in unencrypted files on your computer</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For more detailed information about password security, check out our article on <a href="/blog/password-manager">Why You Should Use a Password Manager</a>.</p>

                    <h3>3. Employee Training</h3>
                    <p>Your employees are your first line of defense. Regular training on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifying phishing emails</li>
                        <li>Safe browsing practices</li>
                        <li>Data handling procedures</li>
                        <li>Reporting suspicious activities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. Data Backup Solutions</h3>
                    <p>Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 copies of your data</li>
                        <li>2 different storage types</li>
                        <li>1 off-site backup</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Don't forget to backup your cloud services as well:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Microsoft 365 (Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams)</li>
                        <li>Google Workspace data</li>
                        <li>Cloud-based applications and their data</li>
                        <li>Cloud storage services</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remember: Cloud services are not automatically backed up. While they provide redundancy, they don't protect against accidental deletion, ransomware, or malicious actions. A proper backup strategy should include both on-premises and cloud data.</p>

                    <h3>5. Advanced Threat Protection</h3>
                    <p>Modern businesses need more than just antivirus software. Implement these advanced security solutions:</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>DNS Web Filtering</h4>
                    <p>DNS web filtering provides an additional layer of security by blocking access to malicious websites and controlling web usage:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block access to known malicious websites and phishing domains</li>

                        <li>Detailed reporting on web usage and blocked attempts</li>
                        <li>Works across all devices and locations, including remote workers</li>
