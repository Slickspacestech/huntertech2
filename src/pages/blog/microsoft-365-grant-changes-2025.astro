    Microsoft has announced significant changes to their grant program for non-profits, effective July 1st, 2025. These changes will affect how non-profit organizations access Microsoft 365 services, with the discontinuation of some popular grant offerings and the introduction of new alternatives.

    What's Changing?
    Microsoft is streamlining their grant portfolio to simplify the offering process. The following changes will take effect on July 1st, 2025:
    
    Microsoft 365 Business Premium grant will be discontinued
    Office 365 E1 grant will be discontinued
    New offering: Up to 300 licenses of Microsoft 365 Business Basic
    New offering: Up to 75% discount on many Microsoft 365 offers

    What This Means for Your Organization
    If your non-profit currently uses Microsoft 365 Business Premium or Office 365 E1 through the grant program, you'll need to plan for these changes. Here's what you should know:

    Existing grant recipients will need to transition to the new offerings
    Microsoft 365 Business Basic will be available as a grant option (for free!)
    Significant discounts (up to 75%) will be available for other Microsoft 365 plans
    These changes only affect organizations using the grant program

    Planning Your Transition
    To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend the following steps:

    Review your current Microsoft 365 usage and requirements
    Assess which features you currently use from Business Premium or E1
    Compare your needs with the features available in Business Basic
    Consider the discounted options for any features not covered by Business Basic
    Create a transition timeline before the July 1st deadline

    Available Alternatives
    While the grant changes may seem concerning, Microsoft is still committed to supporting non-profits with their technology needs. The new structure offers:

    Microsoft 365 Business Basic (up to 300 licenses)
    75% discount on Microsoft 365 Business Premium
    75% discount on Office 365 E1
    Access to other Microsoft products at discounted rates

    Understanding Microsoft 365 Business Plans
    To help you make an informed decision about which plan best suits your needs, here's a comparison of the key features across Microsoft 365 Business plans:

    For non-profits focusing on email and basic document collaboration, Basic is likely fine. The 75% discount on Business Standard and Premium plans makes them very cost-effective options for non-profits that need these additional features. We do recommend a 3rd party identity threat product to protect your Microsoft 365 accounts.

    Next Steps
    If your organization is affected by these changes, we recommend:

    Reviewing your current Microsoft 365 usage
    Planning your transition strategy
    Consulting with your IT provider about the best options for your needs
    Taking advantage of the transition period to evaluate your technology requirements

    While these changes may require some adjustment, Microsoft remains committed to supporting non-profits with their technology needs. The new structure aims to provide more clarity and flexibility while maintaining access to essential tools and services.

The 75% discount on Business Standard and Premium plans makes them very cost-effective options for non-profits that need these additional features.
