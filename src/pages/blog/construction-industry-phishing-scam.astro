    How the Scam Works
Anatomy of the Scam
Cybercriminals have compromised the Microsoft 365 email account of Charles Lankester, a known representative associated with AME Group. Leveraging this legitimate identity, attackers have launched a highly convincing phishing campaign targeting businesses across the Greater Vancouver area—particularly in the construction, engineering, and architecture sectors.
The Attack Method
The emails originate from the real AME Group email domain, which makes them difficult to detect as fraudulent at first glance. These messages contain links to what appear to be legitimate RFP (Request for Proposal) documents. The content is professional, the tone is familiar, and the urgency is real—hallmarks of a genuine business opportunity. But instead of leading to a document, the links redirect users to a fake Microsoft 365 login page.
Advanced Attack Technique
Once a recipient enters their credentials on this spoofed page, the attackers capture the login information. But the attack doesn't stop there. The threat actors are also performing session token hijacking, a technique that allows them to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
Here's how that part works:
1.	After a user logs into the fake Microsoft sign-in page, attackers immediately use those credentials to attempt a real-time login to the actual Microsoft 365 platform.
2.	If the user is currently authenticated on their device, or if the attackers can trick them into completing the MFA challenge, the criminals can extract a valid authentication token.
3.	With this token in hand, attackers can bypass MFA altogether, effectively gaining long-term access to the user's account without needing to repeat the login or MFA process.
The Impact
From there, if the account is over permissioned, they can move laterally across the organization's email environment, impersonate staff, send out further phishing emails, and access sensitive internal data.
This blend of phishing and token-based hijacking is extremely dangerous because it combines credential theft with real-time identity compromise, all while maintaining the appearance of a legitimate user session.
These kinds of attacks are no longer "spray-and-pray"—they are targeted, intelligent, and persistent, exploiting both human trust and technical gaps.
How to Detect the Scam
To protect your organization, be on the lookout for the following red flags:
Unexpected RFP Emails
Be cautious of unsolicited RFPs, especially if you haven't initiated contact with the sender's organization.
Generic Language
Emails lacking personalized details or specific project information may indicate a phishing attempt.
Urgent or Pressuring Language
Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prompt quick action without due diligence.
Suspicious Links
Hover over links to verify their legitimacy before clicking. Be wary of URLs that don't match the purported sender's domain.
Requests for Credentials
Legitimate organizations will not ask you to enter sensitive information through unsecured links.
The Importance of Branding Your Microsoft Sign-In Page
Branding your Microsoft 365 sign-in page is a crucial step in defending against phishing attacks. Here's why:
Visual Verification
Customized branding helps users quickly verify the authenticity of the login page.
User Awareness
Consistent branding educates users on what legitimate sign-in pages look like, making it easier to spot fakes.
Enhanced Trust
A branded login page reinforces trust in your organization's digital communications.
3rd party sites, even from your partners will not display your branding. If you see don't see your brand while signing into a 3rd party site, it's a phishing site. There's also few reasons for a 3rd party site to kick you over to your Microsoft 365 login page unless your IT group has set it up for Single Sign On (SSO).
Implementing custom branding can be done through the Microsoft 365 admin center, allowing you to add your company's logo, colors, and background images to the sign-in experience.
Strengthen Your Defense with ITDR
ITDR (Identity Threat Detection and Response) is no longer an optional part of your IT security platform, it's required. Bolster your organization's security posture by investing in Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) solutions. These tools monitor for suspicious activities, detect potential breaches, and respond to threats in real-time.
The ITDR tool we use offers comprehensive protection for as little as $5 per licensed user per month. With features like continuous monitoring, automated threat response, and detailed reporting, you can ensure your organization's identities remain secure.
Immediate Actions if Compromised
If you suspect that your organization has fallen victim to this phishing scam:
Cease All Activity
Stop using the compromised device immediately.
Notify IT/Security Teams
Inform your internal security personnel to initiate incident response protocols.
Reset Credentials
Change passwords for affected accounts and any others using the same credentials.
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Add an extra layer of security to your accounts.
Educate Employees
Conduct training sessions to raise awareness about phishing tactics and prevention strategies.
Stay vigilant and proactive in protecting your organization against evolving cyber threats. Implementing robust security measures and fostering a culture of awareness are key to mitigating risks.
Warning Signs to Watch For
•	Emails requesting immediate action or containing urgent deadlines
•	Links to unfamiliar websites or shortened URLs
•	Requests for sensitive information or login credentials
•	Poor grammar or spelling in the email content
•	Suspicious sender email addresses that don't match the claimed organization
Protecting Your Business
To safeguard your construction business from this and similar scams, implement these essential security measures:
Employee Training
Regular cybersecurity awareness training for all staff members
Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR)
Sophisticated threats need sophisticated tools. ITDR tools monitor for suspicious activities, detect potential breaches, and respond to threats in real-time.
Multi-Factor Authentication & Unique Passwords
Enable MFA for all business accounts and systems and use unique passwords for each account. Even if one account is compromised, the attacker will not be able to access other accounts.
What to Do If You're Targeted
If you or your employees receive a suspicious email:
Do not click any links or download attachments
This is the first step to protect your organization from phishing attacks.
Report the email to your IT department or security team
Reporting suspicious emails helps us to understand the scope of the problem and take appropriate action.
Delete the email immediately
Deleting suspicious emails prevents them from being opened and potentially compromising your organization.
If credentials were compromised, change passwords immediately
Changing passwords for affected accounts and any others using the same credentials is crucial to protect your organization's data.
Contact your financial institutions if any financial information was shared
If your organization's financial information was compromised, it's important to notify your financial institutions immediately.

                            <p>
                                The attackers are using a technique called "branded phishing" to create convincing fake Microsoft sign-in pages. They send emails that appear to be from legitimate sources, such as project managers or suppliers, with links to what looks like a Microsoft login page.

                            <p>
                                The key to their success is that they're using actual Microsoft domains for the initial part of the URL, making it harder for traditional security tools to detect the scam. For example, they might use a URL like:
                                https://login.microsoftonline.com.evil-domain.com
                            </p>

                                This technique is particularly effective because:
                                1. The URL starts with a legitimate Microsoft domain
                                2. The page looks identical to the real Microsoft login
                                3. The attackers use HTTPS, making the connection appear secure
                                4. They target specific individuals with personalized messages
                            </p>

                            ITDR (Identity Threat Detection and Response) is no longer an optional part of your IT security platform, 
                            it's required. Bolster your organization's security posture by investing in Identity Threat Detection and 
                            Response (ITDR) solutions. These tools monitor for suspicious activities, detect potential breaches, and 
                            respond to threats in real-time.
