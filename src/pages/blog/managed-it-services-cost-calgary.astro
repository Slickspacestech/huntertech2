                        <h2 id="pricing-models">Understanding Managed IT Pricing Models</h2>
                        
                        <p>Gone are the days of surprise IT bills and hourly charges that make budgeting impossible. Modern managed service providers (MSPs) in Calgary have shifted to predictable, per-user pricing models that make it easy to forecast your IT expenses.</p>

                        <p>The most common pricing models you'll encounter are:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Per-User Pricing:</strong> A flat monthly fee for each employee (most common)</li>
                            <li><strong>Per-Device Pricing:</strong> Monthly fee based on number of computers/devices</li>
                            <li><strong>Tiered Packages:</strong> Different service levels at different price points</li>
                            <li><strong>All-Inclusive Pricing:</strong> One price covers everything, including hardware</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>At Huntertech, we use a straightforward per-user model because it aligns perfectly with how businesses operate. As you grow and add team members, your IT support scales automatically - no renegotiating contracts or surprise fees.</p>

                        <h2 id="pricing-factors">Factors That Affect IT Service Pricing</h2>

                        <p>Several factors can influence your managed IT costs beyond just user count:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Industry Requirements:</strong> Law firms and accounting firms often need enhanced security and compliance features</li>
                            <li><strong>Current Infrastructure:</strong> Outdated systems may require initial investment to modernize</li>
                            <li><strong>Geographic Distribution:</strong> Multiple locations or remote workers can affect pricing</li>
                            <li><strong>Service Level Agreements:</strong> Faster response times and 24/7 support cost more</li>
                            <li><strong>Specialized Software:</strong> Industry-specific applications may require additional expertise</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 id="hidden-costs">Hidden Costs to Watch For</h2>

                        <p>When comparing managed IT providers in Calgary, be aware of these potential hidden costs:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Onboarding Fees:</strong> Some providers charge $500-$5,000 for initial setup</li>
                            <li><strong>Project Labour:</strong> Many MSPs charge hourly for projects outside regular support</li>
                            <li><strong>After-Hours Support:</strong> Emergency support often comes with premium rates</li>
                            <li><strong>Hardware Markup:</strong> Some providers add significant margins to hardware purchases</li>
                            <li><strong>Contract Minimums:</strong> Watch for minimum user requirements that don't fit your size</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>At Huntertech, we believe in transparency. Our Complete tier includes all project labour, and we clearly communicate any costs upfront.</p>

                        <h2 id="roi">ROI of Managed IT Services</h2>

                        <p>While the monthly cost might seem significant, consider the return on investment:</p>

                        <h3>Real ROI From Our Calgary Clients:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Prevent Costly Downtime:</strong> Proactive monitoring catches issues before they impact your business</li>
                            <li><strong>Stop Security Threats:</strong> 24/7 monitoring blocks attacks before they cause damage</li>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <div class="roi-calculator">
                            <h4>Quick ROI Check:</h4>
                            <p>Consider this: if your business loses even a few hours per month to IT issues, the cost of downtime often exceeds the monthly investment in managed services.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Compared to In-House IT:</h3>
                        <p>Hiring a single IT employee in Calgary costs:</p>

                            <li>Salary: $70,000-$90,000</li>
                            <li>Benefits and overhead: $20,000-$30,000</li>
                            <li>Training and certifications: $5,000-$10,000</li>
                            <li><strong>Total: $95,000-$130,000 annually</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>For the same investment, you could provide managed IT services for 50-80 employees with a full team of experts available.</p>
