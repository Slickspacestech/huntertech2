This scenario is affecting businesses from coast to coast - Toronto to Vancouver, Calgary to Montreal, and everywhere in between.</p>

                            <h3>A Real Scenario We're Solving Right Now:</h3>
                            <p>Just last month, we helped a property management firm escape exactly this situation. Their previous provider had renewed their yearly Microsoft licenses without permission, then refused to transfer them until a disputed final bill was paid. Meanwhile, the business was stuck paying unwanted MSP fees.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>License Lock-In:</strong> Can't move to a new provider because current one controls your Microsoft CSP account</li>
                                <li><strong>Unauthorized Renewals:</strong> Yearly commitments made without your approval, trapping you in unwanted contracts</li>
                                <li><strong>Hostage Tactics:</strong> Providers withholding license transfers over payment disputes or to prevent client departure</li>
                                <li><strong>Double Billing:</strong> Forced to pay current provider while unable to switch to preferred IT support</li>
                                <li><strong>Service Disruption Risk:</strong> Fear that changing providers will cause email, file access, and productivity tool downtime</li>

                        <h3>Do I need to switch my IT provider to use this service?</h3>
                        <p>No. This is purely a licensing rescue service. You can keep your current IT support team, find a new one, or handle IT internally. We're just the neutral party that safely holds your Microsoft licenses until you decide what's best for your business.</p>
                    </div>

                        <h3>What if I already have an MSP lined up?</h3>
                        <p>Honestly, if you have a replacement provider lined up, they can handle the transfer. We're just the neutral party that safely holds your Microsoft licenses until you decide what's best for your business.</p>

                        <h3>How long does the license transfer process take?</h3>
                        <p>Most Microsoft CSP transfers complete within 5-7 business days. Emergency transfers (when current provider is threatening service cutoff) can often be expedited to 48-72 hours. Throughout the process, your team maintains full access to all Microsoft services in good standing.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What happens to our email and data during the transfer?</h3>
                        <p>Nothing. Your email, OneDrive files, SharePoint sites, and Teams remain completely accessible. The transfer happens at the billing and administrative level - your users won't even notice the change has occurred.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can you help identify duplicate or unnecessary licenses?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Our free license audit typically identifies 20-30% cost savings through duplicate elimination, incorrect license assignments, right-sizing user accounts, and removing unused Microsoft services. Many businesses discover they're paying for licenses they don't need.  Depending on your license term with Microsoft, you may not be able to cancel those services until their renewal period</p>

                        <h3>What are your rates for temporary license management?</h3>
                        <p>We charge Microsoft rates with no markup during the rescue period depending on the contract terms for the current licenses.  We do not charge any additional fees for the rescue period.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is it legal for my MSP to withhold my Microsoft licenses?</h3>
                        <p>No. Microsoft's Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) agreement explicitly prohibits resellers from withholding license transfers or admin access. When an MSP refuses to transfer your licenses or denies you admin access to your own Microsoft services, they are in direct violation of their contract with Microsoft. This is considered an abuse of the CSP program.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What does Microsoft's CSP agreement say about license ownership?</h3>
                        <p>According to Microsoft's CSP terms, you (the customer) own your data and licenses. The reseller is merely a billing intermediary. Microsoft requires CSP partners to cooperate with customer transfer requests and maintain customer access to their services. Holding licenses "hostage" over payment disputes violates these core requirements.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I report my MSP to Microsoft for withholding licenses?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Microsoft takes CSP agreement violations seriously. If your provider is refusing to transfer licenses or denying admin access, you can file a complaint with Microsoft Partner Support. We can help document the violation and assist with the reporting process while we execute your license rescue.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What rights do I have as a Microsoft customer?</h3>
                        <p>As the end customer, you have the right to: transfer your licenses to any authorized CSP provider, maintain admin access to your Microsoft tenant, receive your data upon request, and choose your billing partner freely. Any MSP that denies these rights is violating both Microsoft's terms and potentially Canadian business law.</p>
